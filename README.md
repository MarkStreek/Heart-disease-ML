# Heart-disease-ML

The goal of this project is to create a machine learning model where a heart disease can be predicted using clinical variabeles. Of course, we want a model that uses the smallest amount of attributes and reaches the highest accuracy. 

The project is diversed in three subjects:

1. Explorative Data Analysis
2. Creating a Machine learning model
3. Creating Java application that deploys the model

The first two subjects can be found inside this project. The Java application is placed inside another [repository](https://github.com/MarkStreek/PredictingHeartDiseaseJavaWrapper).

The whole procces of this project is described in the file: **Predicting_heaer_disease.Rmd**. There is a pdf version of this file, for easier reading.

Project Structure:

<pre>
.
├── Heart_Disease_Prediction.csv: The original dataset for this project
├── Predicting_heart_disease.Rmd: Full log about this project
├── README.md
└── Verslag.pdf: Full report about this project
</pre>

The file **verslag.pdf** contains a full report (in Dutch) about this project. The folder **PredictingHeartDiseaseJavaWrapper** is a submodule that contains the Java application
